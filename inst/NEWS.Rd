\section{Changes in version 1.1-0}{
  \itemize{

    \item The gridSVG package now uses Imports, rather than Depends for
    its dependencies. This means all of the examples must now explicitly
    load the dependencies too.

    \item Bugfix to MDS examples. Point highlighting was not working
    correctly as it needed to know the mapped ID via `getSVGMappings()`.

  }
}

\section{Changes in version 1.0-0}{
  \itemize{
      \item First release of this package. Contains examples relating to
      the content of my Masters Thesis.
  }
